            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>How's work/ what do you do?</h3>
	        <p>Perhaps the most common icebreaker. I currently do not like being asked this, but that is mainly because I am not in love with the work I do. Working 9-5 (its actually 7:30-3:30) seems like a nessescitude and if I could give it al up I would. However, I also recognize that my ideal self loves getting asked this. I want to be in a place where my work is so inspiring that I jump at every opportunity to talk about it. </p>
