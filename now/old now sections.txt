What am I doing now?

Updated: June 24 2025
Well, I got a new job in a new industry and moved to a new country (Vancouver, Canada -> San fran, USA). Things are different. Focused on work and excelling professionally. Working hard, but still keeping up with BJJ, the gym, and reading. The personal brand continues to be built slowly in the background.

I am trying to decide what to do next. I feel like I am ready for a new challenge in my working life and have ideas, but I need to evaluate them... while balancing well-thought-out decisions and analysis paralysis.

I recently got my bjj blue belt after 3 years of training. I am also focused on revamping my personal newsletter and workign on copywriting and data analytics skills.
